# Make a Dictionary

To make a dictionary, you need an authoritative word-list for a given language.

For this exercise, we will use dictionaries created for the open-source [aspell](http://aspell.net) spell-checker.

## Install `aspell` in the VM

**In the VM** to the following:

- `sudo apt-get install aspell`
- Type `y` when it asks you to confirm.

Things to know:

- `apt-get` is the "package manager" for Ubuntu Linux, like an AppStore.
- `sudo` = "Super User DO", run a command as an administrator. On a "real" Linux machine, you would have to type a password after issuing that command; in the Vagrant environment you do not.
